# bulkDeviceManagement
first of all, you can understand how little I know about these concepts. I am open to make it better an learn. 
this is something I created for making quicker bulk tasks about device management. 
I have used paramiko to connect to devices via ssh. (https://www.paramiko.org/)

I want to thank the guy who explained paramiko very well in his channel. you can visit from the link below:

py script to manage multiple devices with same credentials via ssh
you can edit the txt files according to your host information, credential information and commands you want. 
after all ready, you can run the py script to make it run the commands you want on all hosts you want. 
the output txt file will be created to see what happened.
